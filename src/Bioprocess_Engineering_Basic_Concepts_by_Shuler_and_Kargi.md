# Bioprocess Engineering: Basic Concepts by Shuler and Kargi
 
Bioprocess engineering is the discipline that applies engineering principles and techniques to the design, analysis, control, and optimization of biological systems and processes. It is an interdisciplinary field that combines aspects of chemical engineering, microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and biotechnology.

One of the most comprehensive and widely used textbooks on bioprocess engineering is *Bioprocess Engineering: Basic Concepts* by Michael L. Shuler and Fikret Kargi. The book was first published in 1992 and has been updated and revised in subsequent editions. The latest edition, the third one, was published in 2017 and co-authored by Matthew DeLisa.
 
The book covers the fundamental concepts of bioprocessing, such as the structure and function of different types of microorganisms, metabolic pathways, enzymes, microbial genetics, kinetics and stoichiometry of growth and product formation, mass and energy balances, transport phenomena, bioreactor design and operation, downstream processing, and bioprocess economics. It also introduces some advanced topics, such as metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, biofuels, biopharmaceuticals, tissue engineering, and biosensors. The book includes numerous examples, problems, case studies, and references to help students learn and apply the concepts.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I: Introduction to Engineering Calculations and Bioreactions; Part II: Bioreactors; Part III: Downstream Processing; Part IV: Special Topics. The book has a total of 18 chapters and 414 pages. A solutions manual for the book is also available for instructors.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in chemical engineering, biochemical engineering, biotechnology, bioengineering, and related fields. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the biotechnology industry.
  
In this article, we will review some of the key concepts and topics covered in the book *Bioprocess Engineering: Basic Concepts* by Shuler and Kargi. We will also provide some examples and applications of bioprocess engineering in various fields and industries.
 
## Microorganisms and Metabolism
 
Microorganisms are living organisms that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. They include bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, protozoa, and viruses. Microorganisms play important roles in nature and human activities, such as decomposing organic matter, cycling nutrients, producing oxygen, fermenting foods and beverages, synthesizing drugs and chemicals, degrading pollutants, and causing diseases.
 
Microorganisms can be classified based on their morphology (shape and structure), physiology (metabolic capabilities and requirements), genetics (DNA sequence and organization), and phylogeny (evolutionary relationships). Some of the common methods for identifying and characterizing microorganisms are microscopy, staining, culture techniques, biochemical tests, molecular techniques, and immunological techniques.
 
Metabolism is the sum of all the chemical reactions that occur within a cell or organism. It involves two types of reactions: catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy and reducing power. Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, consuming energy and reducing power. The energy and reducing power generated by catabolism are used to drive anabolism and other cellular processes.
 
Metabolic pathways are the sequences of enzymatic reactions that convert substrates into products. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up the rate of metabolic reactions without being consumed or altered. Enzymes have specific structures and functions that depend on their amino acid sequences and cofactors. Enzymes can be regulated by various factors, such as temperature, pH, substrate concentration, product concentration, inhibitors, activators, feedback mechanisms, and genetic expression.
 
Microorganisms can use different types of substrates as sources of carbon and energy for their metabolism. Based on their carbon source, microorganisms can be classified as autotrophs or heterotrophs. Autotrophs can use inorganic carbon (such as CO<sub>2</sub>) as their sole carbon source. Heterotrophs require organic carbon (such as glucose) as their carbon source. Based on their energy source, microorganisms can be classified as phototrophs or chemotrophs. Phototrophs can use light as their energy source. Chemotrophs can use chemical compounds as their energy source.
 
The most common metabolic pathways for catabolism are glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), electron transport chain (ETC), and fermentation. Glycolysis is the conversion of glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Pentose phosphate pathway is the conversion of glucose into ribose-5-phosphate and other pentoses, generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). TCA cycle is the oxidation of acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A) into CO<sub>2</sub>, generating ATP, NADH, FADH<sub>2</sub> (flavin adenine dinucleotide), and GTP (guanosine triphosphate). ETC is the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub>, generating a proton gradient across the membrane that drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. Fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate or other intermediates into various end products (such as ethanol, lactic acid, acetone) under anaerobic conditions or in the absence of an external electron acceptor.
 
## Kinetics and Stoichiometry of Growth and Product Formation
 
Kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical reactions and biological processes. Stoichiometry is the study of the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions and biological processes.
 
In bioprocess engineering, kinetics and stoichiometry are used to describe and predict the growth of microorganisms and the formation of products in bioreactors. Some of the important parameters that characterize the kinetics and stoichiometry of bioprocesses are specific growth rate (Î¼), specific product
