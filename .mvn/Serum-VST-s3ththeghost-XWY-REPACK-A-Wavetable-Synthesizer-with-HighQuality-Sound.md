You can choose from distortion, compression, EQ, filter, delay, reverb, flanger, phaser, chorus, and hyper/dimension. Each effect has its own set of parameters that can be tweaked and modulated to create unique sounds. You can also use the global tab to adjust the master volume, tuning, polyphony, portamento, and oversampling settings.
